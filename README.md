# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Basics

Welcome!  
This repository contains my practice files from following the [JS Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JSMastery) YouTube channel and the video [JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/g7T23Xzys-A?si=vT28_oQcvU6UZxGL).

Iâ€™ve added comments in the code to help me understand and revise key concepts.
